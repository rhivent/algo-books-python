When you surf the web, send an email, or log in to a laboratory computer
from another location on campus a lot of work is going on behind the
scenes to get the information on your computer transferred to another
computer. The in-depth study of how information flows from one computer
to another over the Internet is the primary topic for a class in
computer networking. However, we will talk about how the Internet works
just enough to understand another very important graph algorithm.

![Overview of connectivity in the internet](figures/internet.png)

The diagram above shows you a high-level overview of how communication
on the Internet works. When you use your browser to request a web page
from a server, the request must travel over your local area network and
out onto the Internet through a router. The request travels over the
Internet and eventually arrives at a router for the local area network
where the server is located. The web page you requested then travels
back through the same routers to get to your browser. Inside the cloud
labeled “Internet” in the diagram are additional routers. The job of all
of these routers is to work together to get your information from place
to place. You can see there are many routers for yourself if your
computer supports the `traceroute` command. The text below shows the
output of running `traceroute google.com` on the author’s computer,
which illustrates that there are 12 routers between him and the Google
server responding to the request.

Each router on the Internet is connected to one or more other routers.
So if you run the `traceroute` command at different times of the day,
you are likely to see that your information flows through different
routers at different times. This is because there is a cost associated
with each connection between a pair of routers that depends on the
volume of traffic, the time of day, and many other factors. By this time
it will not surprise you to learn that we can represent the network of
routers as a graph with weighted edges.

![Connections and weights between routers in the
internet](figures/route-graph.png)

Above we show a small example of a weighted graph that represents the
interconnection of routers in the Internet. The problem that we want to
solve is to find the path with the smallest total weight along which to
route any given message. This problem should sound familiar because it
is similar to the problem we solved using a breadth first search, except
that here we are concerned with the total weight of the path rather than
the number of hops in the path. It should be noted that if all the
weights are equal, the problem is the same.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm
---

The algorithm we are going to use to determine the shortest path is
called “Dijkstra’s algorithm.” Dijkstra’s algorithm is an iterative
algorithm that provides us with the shortest path from one particular
starting node to all other nodes in the graph. Again this is similar to
the results of a breadth first search.

To keep track of the total cost from the start node to each destination
we will make use of a `distances` dictionary which we will initialize to
`0` for the start vertex, and `infinity` for the other vertices. Our
algorithm will update these values until they represent the smallest
weight path from the start to the vertex in question, at which point we
will return the `distances` dictionary.

The algorithm iterates once for every vertex in the graph; however, the
order that we iterate over the vertices is controlled by a priority
queue. The value that is used to determine the order of the objects in
the priority queue is the distance from our starting vector. By using a
priority queue, we ensure that as we explore one vertex after another,
we are always exploring the one with the smallest distance.

The code for Dijkstra’s algorithm is shown below.
"""

import heapq


def calculate_distances(graph, starting_vertex):
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    distances[starting_vertex] = 0

    entry_lookup = {}
    pq = []

    for vertex, distance in distances.items():
        entry = [distance, vertex]
        entry_lookup[vertex] = entry
        heapq.heappush(pq, entry)

    while len(pq) > 0:
        _, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(pq)

        for neighbor, neighbor_distance in graph[current_vertex].items():
            distance = distances[current_vertex] + neighbor_distance
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                entry_lookup[neighbor][0] = distance

    return distances


example_graph = {
    'U': {'V': 2, 'W': 5, 'X': 1},
    'V': {'U': 2, 'X': 2, 'W': 3},
    'W': {'V': 3, 'U': 5, 'X': 3, 'Y': 1, 'Z': 5},
    'X': {'U': 1, 'V': 2, 'W': 3, 'Y': 1},
    'Y': {'X': 1, 'W': 1, 'Z': 1},
    'Z': {'W': 5, 'Y': 1},
}
# calculate_distances(example_graph, 'X')
# => {'U': 1, 'W': 2, 'V': 2, 'Y': 1, 'X': 0, 'Z': 2}

"""
Dijkstra’s algorithm uses a priority queue, which we introduced in the
trees chapter and which we achieve here using Python’s `heapq` module.

The entries in our priority queue are lists of `[distance, vertex]`
which allows us to maintain a queue of vertices sorted by distance.

When the distance to a vertex that is already in the queue is reduced,
we wish to update the distance and thereby move it to the front of the
queue. We accomplish this by maintaining a mapping of vertices to
entries in our queues as `entry_lookup`. When we wish to update the
distance to a vertex, we retrieve the entry from `entry_lookup` and
update the 0-th item in the list.

Let’s walk through an application of Dijkstra’s algorithm one vertex at
a time using the following sequence of diagrams as our guide. We begin
with the vertex $$u$$. The three vertices adjacent to $$u$$ are $$v,w,$$ and
$$x$$. Since the initial distances to $$v,w,$$ and $$x$$ are all initialized
to `infinity`, the new costs to get to them through the start node are
all their direct costs. So we update the costs to each of these three
nodes. We also set the predecessor for each node to $$u$$ and we add each
node to the priority queue. We use the distance as the key for the
priority queue. The state of the algorithm is:

![ ](figures/dijkstraa.png)

In the next iteration of the `while` loop we examine the vertices that
are adjacent to $$u$$. The vertex $$x$$ is next because it has the lowest
overall cost and therefore bubbled its way to the beginning of the
priority queue. At $$x$$ we look at its neighbors $$u,v,w$$ and $$y$$. For
each neighboring vertex we check to see if the distance to that vertex
through $$x$$ is smaller than the previously known distance. Obviously
this is the case for $$y$$ since its distance was `infinity`. It is not
the case for $$u$$ or $$v$$ since their distances are 0 and 2 respectively.
However, we now learn that the distance to $$w$$ is smaller if we go
through $$x$$ than from $$u$$ directly to $$w$$. Since that is the case we
update $$w$$ with a new distance and change the predecessor for $$w$$ from
$$u$$ to $$x$$. The state of the algorithm is now:

![ ](figures/dijkstrab.png)

The next step is to look at the vertices neighboring $$v$$ (below). This
step results in no changes to the graph, so we move on to node $$y$$.

![ ](figures/dijkstrac.png)

At node $$y$$ (below) we discover that it is cheaper to get to both
$$w$$ and $$z$$, so we adjust the distances and predecessor links
accordingly.

![ ](figures/dijkstrad.png)

Finally we check nodes $$w$$ and $$z$$. However, no additional changes
are found and so the priority queue is empty and Dijkstra’s algorithm
exits.

![ ](figures/dijkstrae.png)

![ ](figures/dijkstraf.png)

It is important to note that Dijkstra’s algorithm works only when the
weights are all positive. You should convince yourself that if you
introduced a negative weight on one of the edges to the graph that the
algorithm would never exit.

We will note that to route messages through the Internet, other
algorithms are used for finding the shortest path. One of the problems
with using Dijkstra’s algorithm on the Internet is that you must have a
complete representation of the graph in order for the algorithm to run.
The implication of this is that every router has a complete map of all
the routers in the Internet. In practice this is not the case and other
variations of the algorithm allow each router to discover the graph as
they go. One such algorithm that you may want to read about is called
the “distance vector” routing algorithm.

Analysis of Dijkstra’s Algorithm
---

Finally, let us look at the running time of Dijkstra’s algorithm. We
first note that building the priority queue takes $$O(V)$$ time since we
initially add every vertex in the graph to the priority queue. Once the
queue is constructed the `while` loop is executed once for every vertex
since vertices are all added at the beginning and only removed after
that. Within that loop each call to `heappop`, takes $$O(\log V)$$ time.
Taken together that part of the loop and the calls to heappop take $$O(V
\log(V))$$. The `for` loop is executed once for each edge in the graph,
and within the `for` loop updating the distance for the neighbor vertex
in the priority queue takes time $$O(E\log(V)).$$ So the combined
running time is $$O((V+E) \log(V)).$$
